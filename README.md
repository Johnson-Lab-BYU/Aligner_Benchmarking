# Aligner_Benchmarking

SamCompare4.6.py was used to compare the Art generated SAM file to the aligner generated SAM file. Both files need to be sorted with the same linux sort command prior to the comparision.
incorrectLineAnalysisJuly10.py was used to generated the further analysis on the incorrectly aligned subset from the SamCompare.
